# What is platform module?

this module is a small set of header files that define
platform-independent data types and macros. As such
it is similar to many projects that have a platform.h,
system.h, defines.h, etc. file. The difference is that
`platform` is very comprehensive and is the annointed
gottingen c++ worldwide standard for new projects.

With respect to the base types and definitions, many
of these are already present in the most recent C
language standard, though the C++ standard has yet to
formally adopt them. `platform` bridges the gap and defines
these values if they aren't already defined. With
respect to compiler and platform definitions, `platform`
provides a standard reliable means of identifying or
specifying compilers, platforms, endian-ness, alignment
attributes, etc.

# Usage notes

You probably don't want to use float_t and double_t.
They are there for C99 compatibility but are rarely
what you want to use, since their size is variable.

Prid8, etc. are somewhat painful and ugly to use and
you may find you don't like them. They too are for
C99 compatibility.

intptr_t is not a pointer to an int; it's an int with
the same size as a pointer, so you can safely store
pointers in it.
